\value{
A list containing data frames with trends and significance values for both stations and regions.
}
\description{
This function reads the indices calculated previously and calculates the trend for
the period specified by the user.It produces a map of each of these trends by station.
}
\details{
This function is adapted from the \href{https://github.com/ET-NCMP/NCMP}{ET-NCMP/NCMP} and modified for use in R-Instat.
The modifications include changes to data input and output processes while preserving the core calculation methods.

# Example usage of 'p5_trends_graphs':

#                ne = 1:8, nyba = 1950, nyea = 2020, nyb = 1960, nye = 2020, ncmp_folder = "output_folder",
