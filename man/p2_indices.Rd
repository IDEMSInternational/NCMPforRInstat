\value{
A data frame containing calculated monthly and annual climate indices.
}
\description{
This function calculates various climatological monthly and annual climate indices
using daily climate data.The indices include mean temperature, temperature anomalies, precipitation totals,
precipitation anomalies, standardized precipitation index (SPI), and various temperature percentiles.
}
\details{
This function is adapted from the \href{https://github.com/ET-NCMP/NCMP}{ET-NCMP/NCMP} and modified for use in R-Instat.
The modifications include changes to data input and output processes while preserving the core calculation methods.
The function calculates various climate indices for each station in the given data frame.It requires daily climate data,
including maximum temperature (tmax), minimum temperature (tmin),and precipitation (precip). The function calculates monthly
and annual indices, including mean temperature,temperature anomalies, precipitation totals, precipitation anomalies,
standardized precipitation index (SPI),and various temperature percentiles. The climatology is defined by
the \code{nybr} (start year) and \code{nyer} (end year) parameters.
